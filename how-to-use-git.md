# How to use `git`
1. Initialize a repository with `git init`
2. Stage your files with `git add <filename>`
3. Whenever you made a substantial change, put it into the history with `git commit -m <message>`
4. See your history with `git log`
5. Move around (history and branches!) with `git checkout <branch|commitHash>`
6. Create new branches with `git checkout -b <branchName>`
7. To collaborate, first `pull` others changes, then `push` yours
